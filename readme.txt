*** NEW:
*** First hacky build using 64-bit MinGWBuilds compiler and libraries
*** Well, it builds, but it hasn't been tested at all!
*** Now builds with both TDM 32 bit and MingWBuilds 64 bit. Also seems to work with both!

This is the source for csvfix and the supporting alib library.
To build, enter the command "make win" for a Windows build 
or "make lin" for a Linux/Unix build.

For further information, please see the CSVfix website 
at http://code.google.com/p/csvfix.
