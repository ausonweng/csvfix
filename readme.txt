*** NEW:
*** First hacky build using 64-bit MinGWBuilds compiler and libraries
*** Well, it builds, but it hasn't been tested at all!

This is the source for csvfix and the supporting alib library.
To build, enter the command "make win" for a Windows build 
or "make lin" for a Linux/Unix build.

For further information, please see the CSVfix website 
at http://code.google.com/p/csvfix.
